# 5 Essential Steps to Build a Powerful Trip Tracker Web App with Go and HTMX

Tags: Go, HTMX, Web Development, SQLite, Travel

If you've ever wanted to track your trips seamlessly and intuitively, this step-by-step guide shows you exactly how to build your own interactive travel tracking application—just like "Mia's Trips." Built using Go, SQLite, HTMX, and Tailwind CSS, this project is perfect for anyone looking to dive deep into web application development.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment to Hit the Ground Running

Before you can build, you must set up the essentials:

- **Install Go (Version 1.23.5 or newer):**

  ```bash
  go version
  ```

- **Install SQLite (Quick and reliable storage):**

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install sqlite3
  sqlite3 --version
  ```

- **Install Templ and HTMX (Dynamic UI updates):**

  ```bash
  templ generate
  ```

- **Integrate Tailwind CSS for elegant, responsive designs:**

  ```bash
  ./tailwindcss -i ./static/css/input.css -o ./static/css/output.css --watch
  ```

- **Implement Middleware for security, logging, and headers:**

  ```go
  func CSPMiddleware(next http.HandlerFunc) http.HandlerFunc {
    // Middleware logic
  }
  ```

## Step 2: Craft a Robust and Efficient Database Schema

A well-designed database is the backbone of your app:

- **Users Table:** Securely store user data with hashed passwords.
- **Trips Table:** Manage detailed trip information linked to airports.
- **Airports Table:** Populate easily via CSV for comprehensive location data.

Example of adding new trips:

```go
func (t *TripStore) CreateTrip(newTrip m.Trip) (int64, error) {
  q := `INSERT INTO trips (user_id, departure, arrival, ...) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ...)`
  stmt, err := t.db.Prepare(q)
  // Handle insert logic
}
```

## Step 3: Build Robust Backend Logic and Integrate Real-Time APIs

Backend logic organizes your app’s core functionality:

- **Define Clear Handlers:** Structure your Go handlers clearly for maintainability:

  ```go
  type PostTripHandler struct {
    tripStore *db.TripStore
  }

  func (h *PostTripHandler) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Form processing and validation
    newTrip := models.Trip{
      UserId: userId,
      Departure: departure,
      Arrival: arrival,
      DepartureTime: uint32(parsedDepartureTime.Unix()),
      ArrivalTime: uint32(parsedArrivalTime.Unix()),
      Airline: airline,
      FlightNumber: flightNumber,
      Reservation: &reservation,
      Terminal: &terminal,
      Gate: &gate,
    }

    _, err := h.tripStore.CreateTrip(newTrip)
    if err != nil {
      http.Error(w, "Error creating trip", http.StatusInternalServerError)
      return
    }

    w.Header().Set("HX-Redirect", "/trips")
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
  }
  ```

- **Real-Time Flight Data:** Use AviationStack API to provide users with accurate and timely flight information, managing timezones and data consistency carefully.

## Step 4: Create a Smooth, Engaging Frontend

Your frontend should be intuitive and dynamic:

- **Interactive Components with HTMX:** Seamlessly load trip data without full page reloads:

  ```html
  <button hx-get="/trips" hx-target="#trip-list" hx-swap="innerHTML">
    Load Trips
  </button>
  ```

- **Templ Templates:** Use Templ for modular and maintainable HTML templates:

  ```go
  templ Layout(contents templ.Component, title string) {
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>{title}</title>
        <!-- Scripts and stylesheets here -->
      </head>
      <body>
        <header><!-- Navigation --></header>
        <main>{contents}</main>
        <footer><!-- Footer --></footer>
      </body>
    </html>
  }
  ```

- **Map Integration:** Use Leaflet.js to visualize user trips clearly on interactive maps.

- **Enhanced Security:** Implement robust CSP headers to ensure your app is safe from cross-site scripting (XSS) threats.

## Step 5: Deploy Smoothly to Production with Docker and Traefik

Make deployment effortless and reliable:

- **Docker and Docker Compose:** Efficient containerization simplifies deployment:

  ```bash
  docker compose up --build -d
  ```

- **Traefik Reverse Proxy:** Optimize traffic routing and SSL management.

- **Automated Updates:** Watchtower handles seamless Docker updates automatically.

- **Hostinger VPS:** A budget-friendly and effective solution for hosting your app, supported by extensive online guides.

## Action Items:

- Follow each step carefully to ensure smooth progress.
- Regularly test and validate each component before proceeding.
- Continuously enhance security measures and user interactions.

## Conclusion

By following these clear, detailed steps, you’ll build a robust, secure, and highly interactive trip tracking application. Dive into the code, explore further customizations, and transform your ideas into reality!
