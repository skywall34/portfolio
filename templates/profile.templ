                I'm a software developer with 7 years of experience and counting. 
                I enjoy learning new technologies and specialize in building services mostly backend and infrastructure related to real time systems.
                More recently I've become interested in learning more about machine learning, 
                especially in regards to MLOps and building systems helping to automate model training/deployment.

                In my free time, I either like to play video games, hang out with my beautiful wife, or work on side projects. Feel free to look at what I've been working on here!
